### About

Experiments in data science on my gmail inbox.

To retrieve the contents of your entire gmail account run:

```
python gmail.py [host] [user] [password]
```

The script will fetch all the email messages from the account and dump them via the `pickle` module for subsequent analysis.

For gmail, you will want to set up an app password in order for the script to be able to log in to the account.

The analysis scripts are to come!
